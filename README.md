About

This is an implementation of Orderly JSON (http://orderly-json.org/) for use on
the JVM.  The parser is written in Scala.

The Orderly reference implementation can translate bi-directionally between
Orderly and JSON schema.  At present, this implementation only translates to
JSON schema, not back into Orderly.
